I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Geomatics Engineering at the University of Calgary. I received my MSc in Forestry from the University of New Brunswick where I worked on the spatial analysis applied to the field of forest ecology. My current research interests are in the usability of Discrete Global Grid Systems, especially in the digital terrain data management and geospatial operation development in Discrete Global Grids.
