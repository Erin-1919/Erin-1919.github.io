<p>Hello world, I am Erin! I grew up in the southeast of China and achieved a BSc in GIS at Nanjing Forestry University in the city of Nanjing. Moving to Fredericton, New Brunswick in 2016, I got to work on the spatial analysis applied to the field of forest ecology at the University of New Brunswick, where I received my MSc in Forestry. In 2019, I moved to Calgary, Alberta where I started my PhD in the Department of Geomatics Engineering at the University of Calgary. Now I am a PhD candidate, exploring the usability of Discrete Global Grid Systems especially in the digital terrain data management and geospatial operation development in Discrete Global Grids. Geospatial analysis, automating GIS processing, and statistical modeling are my key analytic skills, and I do enjoy them. I call myself a GISer, and love to make maps and graphs. </p>
