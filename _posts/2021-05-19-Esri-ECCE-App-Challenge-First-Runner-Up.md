**This was my second time participating in the Esri ECCE App Challenge, and I was thrilled that our team received First Runner Up. Although the competition was held entirely online and our team only had two members, it turned out to be one of the smoothest and most enjoyable collaborations I have experienced.**

We made use of a variety of Esri technologies, including ArcGIS Dashboards, ArcGIS Web AppBuilder, and ArcGIS Experience Builder, to build an engaging and interactive geospatial application. Alongside these, we also incorporated open-source tools such as Jupyter Notebooks, Binder, and several geospatial Python packages like Geopandas, Fiona, Shapely, and H3-py.

One standout feature of our project was the integration of a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS). By using DGGS for both data analysis and visualization, we aimed to introduce the concept to a broader audience and highlight its potential for spatial analysis and design.
