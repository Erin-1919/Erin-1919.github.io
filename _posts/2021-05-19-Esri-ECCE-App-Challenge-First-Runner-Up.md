**This was my second time participating in the Esri ECCE App Challenge, and I was thrilled that our team earned the First Runner-Up position. Despite the challenge being fully virtual and our team consisting of only two members, it was one of the smoothest and most rewarding collaborations I have experienced.**

We combined a wide range of Esri technologies, including **ArcGIS Dashboards**, **ArcGIS Web AppBuilder**, and **ArcGIS Experience Builder**, to design and deliver an interactive geospatial solution. In parallel, we incorporated several open-source tools such as **Jupyter Notebooks**, **Binder**, and Python packages like **Geopandas**, **Fiona**, **Shapely**, and **H3-py** to support our data processing and analysis workflows.

A unique highlight of our project was the integration of **Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS)**. By leveraging DGGS in both our analysis and visualizations, we aimed to introduce and promote the concept to a wider audience through an accessible, application-driven interface.
