**I recently attended the GIS in Education and Research Conference at Hart House, University of Toronto, hosted by Esri Canada. The conference was packed with informative paper sessions and engaging hands-on workshops, offering valuable insights and opportunities for GIS professionals, educators, and students.**

## A Hub for GIS Learning and Community

The event brought together a vibrant community of GIS practitioners, researchers, and students. With multiple parallel sessions covering education, spatial analysis, remote sensing, and geospatial data infrastructure, attendees were able to learn from leading experts and exchange innovative ideas across a wide range of topics.

## Hands-On Engagement

Interactive workshops provided a chance to explore Esriâ€™s latest tools and data services. These sessions emphasized practical applications of GIS technology in educational and research contexts, from ArcGIS Online and Field Maps to StoryMaps and 3D visualizations.

## [**Poster Presentation**](https://Erin-1919.github.io/assets/pdf/ESRI_poster_Li_2022.pdf): Flood Susceptibility on Hexagonal Grids 

I was especially excited to see my poster on display during the event:

**"Flood Susceptibility Analysis on Hexagonal Grid Meshes: A Case Study in Southern New Brunswick, Canada"**

This work applied hexagonal grids to improve spatial consistency and neighborhood analysis for flood risk mapping. It was previously submitted as part of my application for the Esri Young Scholars Award.

## A Memorable and Motivating Experience

Attending this conference was both motivating and rewarding. The diversity of talks and the open atmosphere for discussion reinforced the importance of spatial thinking in addressing real-world challenges. I left with new ideas, new contacts, and a renewed excitement for the future of geospatial science.
