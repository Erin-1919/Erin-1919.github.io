Basic DGGS operations required by OGC include **quantization**, **spatial relation**, and **interoperability**. Quantization operations should be the most fundamental operations that aim to make all types of geospatial data available in the context of DGGS. The specific steps of quantization include crawling of datasets, conversion to an internal format, integration, aggregation, and quality control, among which the key step is the conversion among cell addresses or between cell addresses and geographic coordinates. Most of the current studies that utilize DGGS have their methodologies to have quantization done. Spatial relations include cell-level and object-level queries. Cell-level spatial relation includes sibling relation and parent-child relation, which has been supported by a few open-source libraries like DGGRID. The efficiency of spatial relation queries largely depends on the indexing method under the hood. For example, a hierarchical indexing system benefits parent-child relation search while a coordinate-based indexing system can help with sibling relation search. In terms of object-level relations, query engines can be more complicated. Topology is commonly represented by the Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model (DE-9IM) in traditional GIS, and it can be potentially extended to support topology coding in the context of DGGS, although further consideration is needed. For example, the relationship, exterior A intersecting interior B, may not exist in some cases. It means that we need to turn to an expanded model designed for broad boundary features. Interoperability is a relatively high-level requirement for a mature DGGS, as a spatial data infrastructure. It requires the ability to communicate with end-users or other spatial data infrastructures via standard APIs and data formats. Such development to advance interoperability is still ongoing.
