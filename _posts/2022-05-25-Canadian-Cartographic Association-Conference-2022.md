This is the second time I present at the CCA Annual Conference - a good experience to promote DGGS and broadcast my research. The talk was in Day 1 Session 3: Geographic Information Applications and Association Update, with the topic "Analytical operations for terrain data modeled in Discrete Global Grid Systems". 

### Abstract

Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS) have been increasingly adopted as the framework of multi-source geospatial data. Previous research largely studied the mathematical foundation, developed open-sourced DGGS libraries, and explored their application as integration platforms. This study investigated the analytical operations in a pure hexagonal DGGS environment, including descriptive statistics, topographical and hydrological analysis, and topographic indices based on modeled terrain data. Experiments across multiple resolutions were carried out in three areas with various roughness in Alberta, Canada. With five algorithms proposed to calculate slope gradient and aspect, the cell-based, pair-wise comparison showed strong positive relationships between the gradient resulted from various algorithms, while the aspect direction can vary among different approaches. The impact of the variation in these results can propagate to the flow routing grids, flow accumulation, and topographic indices production. Resolutions influenced the detection of elevation changes and the rate of changes, and the degree of such influence also depended on the roughness of the area. This research sets the stage for the analytical development of general DGGS and helps to bridge the gap between the existing DGGS implementations and DGGS-driven decision-making in the real world.
