**Our lab was invited to host the [ISPRS WG IV/7 (Geo-Data Management) Webinar](https://www.isprs.org/news/announcements/details.aspx?ID=271) on January 10, 2022. The session introduced core concepts of Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS), shared our research progress, and demonstrated a live example using the PYXIS DGGS platform.**

During the webinar, I presented an overview of my research on:

**"Quantization, Analysis, and Application of Terrain Data Modeled in Discrete Global Grid Systems."**

This included methods for converting terrain data into DGGS, running analytical operations such as slope and aspect calculations, and exploring use cases in environmental modeling.

## Webinar Overview

Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS) are gaining attention as a powerful framework for geospatial modeling, analysis, and visualization. Recognized as the spatial backbone of next-generation Digital Earth systems, DGGS enable more precise and scalable ways to organize and reference geospatial data.

This webinar covered:

- An introduction to DGGS concepts  
- Overview of Canadian DGGS initiatives  
- Research activities and outcomes from our group at the University of Calgary  
- A live demonstration using the PYXIS DGGS platform
