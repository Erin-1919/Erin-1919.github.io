**This is a quick reflection on my time management in 2020, based on data tracked by RescueTime.**

Over the year, I logged a total of 1690 hours, with 1620 hours categorized as productive. That is 156 more productive hours than the previous year. Working from home clearly saved a good deal of commute time, which may have contributed to the increase.

According to the report, the longest workday of the year fell on my birthday, July 23. Not sure how I feel about that.
