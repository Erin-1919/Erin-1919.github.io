**I presented our review titled *Mapping Methane: A Review of Bottom-up Gridded Inventories* at the 130th OGC Member Meeting held online in November 2024. The presentation provided an overview of the current landscape of bottom-up methane gridded inventories and emphasized the need for improvements in spatial representation and accuracy.**

## Why Gridded Inventories Matter

Gridded methane inventories are essential for supporting inverse atmospheric analyses, simulating high-emission events, refining local emission estimates, and communicating data to broad audiences. They provide spatial continuity across jurisdictions and enable more intuitive data visualization and comparison.

## Review of Existing Inventories

We examined several global, national, and regional inventories:

**Global examples:**
EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) and Scarpelli’s global inventory both provide emissions at a 0.1° × 0.1° resolution using IPCC Tier 1 methods and spatial proxies to downscale national data.

**National examples:**
The U.S. gridded inventory by Maasakkers et al. (2023) aligns with the EPA GHGI and includes uncertainty estimates. Other countries with national-scale gridded inventories include Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Switzerland.

**Regional examples:**
Inventories developed for California and the Barnett Shale region in Texas demonstrate how regional emission maps can incorporate high-resolution activity data, aircraft measurements, or Monte Carlo simulations to capture site-specific variations.

## Key Limitations of Current Grids

Several limitations were highlighted:

- **Graticule-based issues:** Unequal grid sizes introduce biases in area-based comparisons and contribute to inaccurate spatial attribution, especially in polar regions.
- **Spatial misallocations:** Emissions are sometimes placed in incorrect regions, such as urban areas rather than oil and gas fields.
- **Magnitude underestimation:** Coarse-resolution data often underestimate true emissions, which then propagate through downscaling procedures.

## Toward Better Inventories

To address these shortcomings:

- **Use of Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS):** DGGS ensures equal-area grids and enables robust spatial comparisons at various resolutions.
- **Improved source attribution:** Integrating activity and emissions data at their native resolution can prevent misallocations.
- **More representative emission factors:** Incorporating better emission factor data and activity metrics can reduce underestimation biases.

## Take Home Messages

- High-quality gridded methane inventories are crucial for both scientific and policy applications.
- Current inventories, while valuable, have known limitations in spatial consistency and emission accuracy.
- Moving toward DGGS-based or otherwise spatially consistent frameworks could significantly improve the quality and utility of future methane inventories.
