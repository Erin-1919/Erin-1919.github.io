I attended the web course - [Introduction to Geoprocessing Scripts Using Python](https://www.esri.com/training/catalog/57630435851d31e02a43f054/introduction-to-geoprocessing-scripts-using-python/#!/help/true) - by Esri. It was a fun experience, lasting for three days. ArcPy site package was particularly used. The course helped me to understand the ArcPy classes and functions, perform geoprocessing, create script tools and packages, and more.
