**Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS) offer a powerful spatial framework for organizing, analyzing, and communicating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. If adopted for GHG data management, a DGGS can unlock numerous benefits that address long-standing limitations in current inventories.**

## Integration of Multi-Source Data

GHG monitoring relies on data from satellites, aircraft, ground-based sensors, and industry reports. A DGGS provides a spatially consistent framework to integrate these diverse data sources—regardless of resolution, origin, or format.

## A Standard Data Bucket for Facility and Asset Management

DGGS zones offer unique, persistent identifiers that serve as standardized “buckets” for associating data with specific locations. This enables consistent and unambiguous referencing of facilities, infrastructure, or assets over time.

## True Emission Intensity Comparisons Across Space and Time

Because DGGS cells are equal in area, emission intensities can be fairly compared across locations and years. This removes the distortions introduced by latitude–longitude grids, allowing analysts and policymakers to make meaningful comparisons.

## Spatial Integrity in Visualization

DGGS grids preserve spatial consistency when data is visualized on maps. Viewers are not misled by warped cell sizes or shapes, leading to clearer communication of emissions data to stakeholders and the public.

## Quantitative Spatial Resolution

Each DGGS cell covers a precisely defined area, enabling quantitative analysis of emissions per square kilometer (or other consistent units), a key requirement for regulatory compliance and inventory accuracy.

## Consistent Aggregation at Any Scale

Thanks to its hierarchical structure, a DGGS allows emission data to be rolled up seamlessly from a single facility to a basin or national scale. This scalability supports both localized mitigation strategies and global reporting needs.

## Multiple Granularities for Analysis and Reporting

Different DGGS levels provide built-in support for fine-to-coarse spatial granularity. Analysts can switch between resolutions depending on the purpose: hotspot detection, regional assessment, or national summaries.

## Precise Hotspot Tracking and Trend Monitoring

Each DGGS cell has a fixed location on Earth, allowing precise tracking of high-emission zones and consistent trend analysis over time, which is ideal for identifying emerging problems or verifying mitigation success.

## Informed Monitoring and Survey Design

DGGS grids support the strategic planning of aerial surveys and satellite observations. Coverage can be optimized by aligning collection footprints with DGGS zones, reducing redundancy and improving cost-effectiveness.

## Global Vision: Arctic Methane Monitoring

With full global coverage, DGGS enables consistent monitoring even in remote or data-sparse regions like the Arctic. This is critical for tracking permafrost methane emissions and understanding global climate dynamics.
