**I was honored to be named the First Runner-Up in the 2022 Esri Young Scholars Award competition in Canada. This recognition was a meaningful milestone in my academic journey and a great encouragement for continuing my work in applied geospatial research.**

The poster submitted for the competition was based on a contract project with Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), titled:

**"Flood Susceptibility Modeling on Hexagonal Grid Meshes in Southern New Brunswick, Canada."**

This project explored the use of DGGS-like hexagonal grids to enhance the consistency and interpretability of flood risk mapping. By leveraging ArcGIS tools and spatial analysis techniques, the study aimed to improve flood susceptibility assessments in data-sparse environments.
