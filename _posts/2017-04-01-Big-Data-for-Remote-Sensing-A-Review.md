## ABSTRACT
Every second a massive amount of remote sensing data are generated by various sensors all around the world. Remote sensing data are experiencing an unprecedented growth both in volume and speed. Therefore, a series of challenges are triggered by the arrival of the remote sensing big data era. Fortunately, we are now witnessing the emergence of new technologies and approaches to deal with the big data issues, such as cloud computing, MapReduce, NoSQL database, etc. Based on these techniques, remote sensing big data are widely applied in social science and natural science, including analyzing land cover changes, monitoring vegetation, tracking global climate changes, and so on. The focus of this paper is to summarize the meaning of big data in the remote sensing application context, and to review the challenges as well as the opportunities it brings to us. A case study is also provided to understand what NASA is doing with big data challenges. 

## 1. INTRODUCTION
Since human beings entered the information age, data carriers and data repositories have doubled every several years [1]. In this century, the rapid development of the Internet as well as computer technologies has prompted the emergence of the big data era in many aspects of life (Figure 1). From this perspective, it is undeniable that now we are living in a digital world, in which the massive remotely sensed data are important parts helping people better understand, monitor, and interact with our living planet. As a significant resource, these data gathered from various sensors on airborne vehicles and satellites are of great value in many fields. Remote sensing big data have been applied to deal with a lot of real-world problems, like vegetation monitoring, urban planning, land cover changes analyzing, crop growth forecasting, etc. Given the growing number of airborne and space-borne sensors, and the increasingly high spatial and spectral resolutions, the age of remote sensing big data has already arrived.

Nevertheless, how can we prepare ourselves for the coming of the big data era becomes a big issue nowadays, because the traditional technologies and approaches with which we manage the “moderate” data have become out-of-date. In the context of remote sensing, the digitized world, as well as mobile sensors, are main generators of big data, which are tremendously complicated. As with the big data applications in social and economic fields, remote sensing big data are also of little value until they are understood, processed and analyzed. Therefore, we need the improved technologies and methods to harness the huge volume of remote sensing data and to make the most effective use of them.  

In recent years, researchers have been making every effort to develop the latest techniques to exploit and analyze big data in remote sensing applications. The cloud platform, real-time analysis, MapReduce/ Hadoop technology and other modern machine learning methods and classifiers are particularly of interest. In specific cases, a scalable web service for near-time mapping with cloud computing was applied to high-resolution remote sensing images [2]; MapReduce acted as a technology foundation in developing a cloud-enabled Climate Analytics-as-a-Service to deal with climate change issues [3]; and multi-layer architecture with cloud computing was used in Eolic Park big data management [1].

This paper discusses the main properties of remote sensing big data:  huge volume, high dimension, and high complexity. The properties of remote sensing big data are in accordance with “4V” which people usually define as general big data, while remote sensing big data also have some specific characteristics because of massive metadata, different resolutions, and distributed data centers. Besides, this paper also elaborates the main challenges posed by remote sensing big data. The challenges lie in each stage of remote sensing analysis, including data owning, data storage, data delivery, data computing, data representation, data fusion, visualization, as well as collaboration between different data centers. In addition, state-of-the-art technologies are introduced by a case study of NASA. In the case study, specific programs, techniques, and initiatives led by NASA are presented in detail. 

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The second section discusses the understanding of big data in remote sensing. The third section illustrates challenges in different stages of remote sensing big data analysis. Then, the opportunities brought by big remote sensing data are showed in the fourth section. The fifth section presents the state-of-the-art techniques used to harness big data issues in remote sensing. A case study of NASA is also discussed in this section. Finally, the sixth section draws some general conclusions.

## 2. UNDERSTANDING REMOTE SENSING BIG DATA
People define big data as that which is too big to be reasonably handled by traditional technologies, and describe its characteristics as “4V”, i.e., volume, variety, veracity, and velocity [4]. Inspired by the previous work [5], this paper summarizes the characteristics of big data in remote sensing context as “3H”, i.e., huge volume, high dimension, and high complexity. 

**Huge volume.** The advances in remote sensing led the proliferation of remote sensing data. Currently, over 200 on-orbit satellite sensors are generating remote sensing data, monitoring the global surface, atmosphere, climate changes, vegetation, oceans, etc. The data collected by the space-borne of NASA missions on the GB level every second [6]. It is worth mentioning that since the first Earth observation satellite launched by NASA 50 years ago, there have been more than 510 Earth observation satellite launched all around the world, constituting a the comprehensive Earth observation system (Figure 2) [7]. Related statistics and analyses show that NASA’s Earth Observation System Data and the Information System (EOSDIS) housed 7.5 PB (1PB=1024TB) of data with around 7,000 data sets in 2013, and the European Space Agency held 1.5 PB Earth observation data by 2014 [8], [9]. Data produced by various sensors on Earth observation satellites is increasing at a rate of 4 TB (1TB=1024GB) per day [10].

**High dimension.** In terms of high dimension, remote sensing big data is characterized as multiresolution, including a wide variety of different spatial, temporal, as well as spectral resolution, resulting from a lot of satellites and their sensors. Table1 summarizes the spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution of different remote sensing systems. On the other hand, some of the remote sensing applications, like climate change, need a combination of regional and global data. As a result, these applications trigger the pixel’s multi-dimensionality [10]. The correlation of these data is of high dimension, given different sensors, spatio-temporal resolution as well as physical importance [11]. 

**High complexity.** The high complexity of remote sensing big data comes from three aspects: metadata, format diversity, and data velocity. First, metadata describes the composition of data and the approach by which they were acquired, whose fast growth is always accompanied by that of remote sensing data [12]. For example, the number of metadata records in EOSDIS exceeds 129 million and grows at the rate of 66,000 every day [9]. Besides, the structures of organized metadata are also complex. The geo-metadata usually consist of image parameters, map parameters, projection parameters, and satellite or sensor parameters, which vary with different swath widths, basic sizes, geographical locations, map usages, projection methods, orbital heights, etc. [10]. Second, the complexity of remote sensing big data also lies in the various data formats including HDF, GeoTIFF, netCDF and so on. Each of these data formats has different physical structure, operation interface and library [13]. What is more important, a lot of remote sensing data are based on real-time acquisition and computing. Although the volume and the rate of data gathering may be manageable for a single data center, nation-wide or global data archives are storing massive data waiting for processing [10].

## 3. REMOTE SENSING BIG DATA CHALLENGES
As an on-the-flow analysis, the remote sensing analysis can be divided into three stages: management, processing, and application (Figure 3). The management stage includes data acquisition, data storage, and data transmission. As mentioned above, remote sensing big data are always in huge volume combined with real-time acquisition and multi-scales, so identifying the most important and most closely-related data in the shortest time is of great significance for data owning. Efficient data storage and data delivery are crucial as well. In terms of data processing, these massive remote sensing data cause challenges in every sub-stage including image fusion, classification, radiometric correction, image enhancement, etc. When applying remote sensing data in the real world, challenges lie in visualization as well as practical collaboration between distributed data centers. The following paragraphs elaborate special challenges and their reasons in each data analyzing stage.

### 3.1. MANAGEMENT
**Acquisition and Identification.** Data acquisition is an important part based on which people can derive data values and address a real remote sensing problem. Challenges exist during acquisition because of heterogeneity of remote sensing data sets. Data gathered from airborne vehicles, satellites or other sensing devices should be preprocessed by geometric correction, atmospheric correction, terrain correction, geo-referencing, and noise removal, during which the data quality can be improved [14]. Furthermore, data will be meaningless unless they are utilized in real applications [15]. The main challenge of remote sensing big data, which is different from the traditional one is how to identify the valuable data, filter “no interest” data, and even combine data from different sources with different formats to solve real-world problems [12]. 

**Storage.** The increasingly advanced aircraft and satellites bring us information with high resolution, which enable us to monitor our living planet with multiple scales and real-time dynamics if we leverage the value of big data. At the same time, however, the variety and volume properties of geospatial big data challenge the physical and logical infrastructures of traditional data storage [16]. With the sharp growth of data sizes, the traditional structure related database will no longer satisfy the big data storage. What is more, the remote sensing data naturally are obtained by geographically distributed data centers all around the world (Figure 4) [10]. As a result, an optimal data storage for remote sensing big data requires the capability to effectively store, concurrently read and write, and reasonably organize the huge amount of data from different sources. Additionally, it should realize high scalability and be available to most people, even non-experts [8].

**Transmission.** Although data centers are generally distributed geographically far away, they can connect to each other by the Internet. So the effective data transmission between data centers through the network is critically required. The communication and connection of data from different sources would cause the time-consuming problem due to network bandwidth limitations [10]. Remote sensing data transmission is needed not only between data centers but also from data centers to users. So-called “data delivery” offers users remote sensing data as well as metadata, both at ground data stations and those networks receiving data from ground stations. In a traditional way, a user download the data from a data archive in networks to their personal computers. It can be inapplicable in the big data context, because of its vast quantity and extremely high diversity. This poses a challenge to data transmission when a large amount of data need receiving and analyzing in a very short time [15].
