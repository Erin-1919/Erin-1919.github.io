This reflection is inspired by the paper *Topology matters: network topology affects outcomes from community ecology neutral models* by [White and Kiester (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2007.11.002). In this context, network topology refers to the structure or arrangement of systematically sampled points, or more intuitively, how those points are connected and what counts as a neighbor. The paper explored whether the spatial structure of ecological communities affects dispersal patterns, using three different topological frameworks: hexagonal tessellations, square tessellations with von Neumann neighborhoods (which consider only the four cardinal directions), and square tessellations with Moore neighborhoods (which include diagonal connections as well).

By running neutral community models across these different structures, the study showed that topology significantly affects ecological outcomes. Specifically, topologies with higher degrees of adjacency led to larger and more evenly distributed populations as dispersal increased. As the probability of dispersal rose, the differences in model outcomes among the different topologies became more pronounced. Hexagonal tessellations, which offer more uniform adjacency relations, often performed better than square tessellations, which suffer from inconsistencies in neighbor definitions due to corner cases and edge effects.

Despite these findings, the influence of spatial topology in ecological models remains underexplored. In one of my Master’s projects, I applied simultaneous autoregressive models based on a square tessellation created through systematic sampling at 2-kilometer intervals. The model used adjacency based on a lattice structure, which at the time seemed standard and straightforward. I had not considered using hexagonal tessellations, likely because they are rarely adopted in ecological sampling and analysis. Yet, this paper made me reflect on how foundational concepts in geostatistics—such as definitions of first-order and second-order neighbors—might need reconsideration if we use alternative tessellations.

The mathematical forms of commonly used spatial statistics like Moran’s I and Getis-Ord G* do not change, but the definition of spatial relationships, the spatial structure, and the weighting matrix would need to be revised. The same applies to spatial models such as autoregressive or auto-covariate regressions, which rely heavily on how spatial dependencies are structured. This would not only require updates to the theoretical formulations but also to the computational routines used in model fitting. Whether switching to a hexagonal structure would lead to substantially different results is an empirical question and likely varies depending on the application. However, these potential differences deserve more attention and should be explored, quantified, and openly discussed in future research.
