> The tools we have most commonly used to interact with data, such as the "desktop metaphor" employed by the Macintosh and Windows operating systems, are not really suited to this new challenge. I believe we need a "Digital Earth" — a multi-resolution, three-dimensional representation of the planet, into which we can embed vast quantities of geo-referenced data.  
> — Al Gore, California Science Center, Los Angeles, January 31, 1998

### Al Gore described an imagined child exploring the Digital Earth to convey its core functionalities:

* **"…sees Earth as it appears from space…"**  
  A Digital Earth begins with a 3D global view at the coarsest resolution.

* **"…zooms in…"**  
  The system should support multiple resolutions, enabling interactive navigation down to detailed local scales.

* **"…takes the equivalent of a magic carpet ride through a 3D visualization…"**  
  It must support real-time rendering, allowing intuitive and immersive exploration.

* **"Terrain is only one of the many kinds of data…"**  
  A Digital Earth integrates various thematic layers, from physical geography to socio-economic data.

* **"…is able to request information…"**  
  The system should allow spatial querying to support user-driven exploration and discovery.

* **"…visualize…she and other students all over the world have collected as part of the GLOBE project"**  
  It should enable citizen participation, making space for volunteered geographic information (VGI).

* **"This information can be seamlessly fused with digital map…"**  
  Multi-source data integration must be smooth and efficient, with minimal preprocessing burden.

* **"…get more information…click on a hyperlink…"**  
  The system should provide links to external, non-spatial data, enriching the user's understanding.

* **"…follow the trail visually from start to finish…"**  
  Dynamic and scenario-based visualizations should be supported for storytelling and analysis.

* **"...but can also travel through time"**  
  Temporal navigation is essential. A true Digital Earth must extend beyond space into time, supporting historical and predictive analysis across various time scales.
