**Our research group was recently invited to participate in a video feature about Geomatics Engineering and Geospatial Data Science. It was a pleasure to be involved and share our passion for spatial technologies and their real-world impact.**

## Sharing the Story of Geospatial Innovation

The video highlights the importance of geospatial data science in addressing pressing environmental and societal challenges. We discussed how technologies such as remote sensing, DGGS, and spatial analytics are enabling smarter decisions in fields like climate monitoring, urban planning, and disaster response.
It was an honor to represent our group and talk about the exciting research we are doing at the intersection of geomatics, data science, and emerging technologies. From methane emission monitoring to digital twins, our team is committed to pushing the boundaries of spatial thinking.
A big thank you to the production team for their professionalism and creativity. It was a fantastic experience from start to finish, and we are proud to be part of a broader effort to raise awareness of the geospatial sciences.
