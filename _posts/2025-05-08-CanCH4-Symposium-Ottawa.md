**I had the pleasure of attending the 2025 CanCH4 Symposium in Ottawa, where I shared our research titled *"Beyond the Graticule: Spatially Explicit Methane Inventories Using Discrete Global Grids."* The event brought together methane researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals from across Canada to advance methane science and action.**

## Session Highlights

**Day 1, Session 2 "Methane Inventories II"**  
**Lightning Talk**: [Watch the video](https://youtu.be/_FMQk5I4agQ)

## The Problem: Inadequate Spatial Grids Limit Action

Current GHG inventories often rely on latitudeâ€“longitude grids (graticule) that vary in cell size and shape across latitudes. This results in:

- Inflated emission densities in high-latitude regions  
- Distorted visualization and interpretation  
- Difficulties in inter-cell comparison and data integration  

These spatial inconsistencies hinder emission attribution, mitigation planning, and multi-sensor data fusion.

## The Opportunity: A Uniform Spatial Framework for GHG Data

Imagine referencing emissions from any facility, basin, or region using a single, equal-area, hierarchical grid. Such a framework enables:

- Seamless reconciliation of bottom-up and top-down inventories  
- Precise source attribution across spatial and administrative boundaries  
- Consistent integration of multi-source, multi-temporal data  
- Spatial indexing of metadata for root cause analysis  

## Our Solution: rHEALPix Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS)

We applied the rHEALPix DGGS to methane emissions in Alberta to demonstrate:

- True emission intensity comparisons across space and time  
- Aggregation from facility to national scale  
- Precise tracking of persistent emission hotspots  
- Informed design of satellite and aerial monitoring strategies  

The fixed, equal-area, hierarchical structure of DGGS presents a robust spatial backbone for next-generation methane inventories and supports actionable insights across scales.
