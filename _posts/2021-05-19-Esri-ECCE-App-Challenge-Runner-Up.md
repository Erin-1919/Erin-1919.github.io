This was the second time I participated in the Esri ECCE App Challenge. We were excited to be announced as the runner-up team in the competition. It was definitely a good experience. Although everything was online and we only had two people in the team, it has been the smoothest collaboration I have ever had. We used a bunch of Esri products to build our web app, such as ArcGIS Dashboards, ArcGIS Web AppBuilder, and ArcGIS Experience Builder. We also adopted open-sourced technologies like Jupyter Notebooks, Binder, geospatial Python packages (Geopandas, Fiona, Shapely, and H3-py).  A unique feature in our projects was the use of a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) to analyze and present data in the maps. I think it was also a good opportunity to promote the DGGS concepts.
