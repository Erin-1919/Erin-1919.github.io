This is the annual report of my time management via RescueTime. The total logged time of the year 2020 was 1690h with 1620h productive hours. That was 156h more than the previous year. I guess working from home saved me a bunch of commute time. The longest day was on my birthday, July 23th,  according to the report, but I literarily forgot what I was working on then...
