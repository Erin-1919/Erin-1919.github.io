I suppose nobody would think a PhD candidacy exam is a fun stuff. Mine was scheduled for Jan. 12th, 2021. I survived, although the whole prep. was overwhelming and intense. I started the prep. study in the middle of Nov., and it lasted for about two months, obviously, throughout the whole Christmas. One of my examiners is in the field of photogrammetry, so I had to study from zero and went through all kinds of calculus/linear algebra equations. I'm not here to complain but hope to encourage people who have to go through a PhD candidacy exam but do not come with an idealy matched background -- like me -- hold a Master of Science in Forestry but do a PhD in Geomatics Engineering. 

Here are some points I would recommend:
- Start early and set up small goals for each week.
- 100% focus on the prep. and temporarily hold off the research (maybe talk to your supervisor in advance).
- After going through the reading material given by Examiners the first time, find your way to draw a framework you read/studied, and probably extend it a little bit based on your knowledge. I used the mind-map; nice to have a try.
- After you have the knowledge framework, go over it by speaking out or writing it down without referring to the original reading materials. See how much you have memorized and what needs more review. For me, I prefer writing stuff down; it helps me to organize the logic (I ended up with a written doc with 30k+ words...).
- Go hang out with friends... although it was tricky during the pandemic lock-down, yet still.
- Remember that your ultimate goal is 60%, not 100%. 

I have orgainzed the doc+mind-map I created during the prep., and hopefully someone would find it helpful. I also contributed to an Esri ECCE blog on this topic: [A ‘Mind Map’ of GIScience Basics](https://ecce.esri.ca/ucalgary-blog/2021/01/12/a-mind-map-of-giscience-basics/).
