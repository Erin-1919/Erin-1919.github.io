There are a few different ways to understand the concept of DGGS, although they are essentially not conflicted. The basic understanding is a **data model**, which is used to digitalize the spatial data, store it in the computer memory, support spatial or thematic analysis, and present or visualize it on the screen. This is equivalent to vector or raster, and just another way to organize and encode spatial data. OGC defined a DGGS as a **spatial reference system** because a DGGS provides such a way that spatial information can be referred to on the Earth's surface. The location of each cell is deterministic with a defined configuration so that a DGGS can be used as a reference system to specifically present geospatial locations. OGC also explained a DGGS as data tiles, data cells, coordinates, tags, graphic cells, and graphic tiles, depending on the different roles it played as. A DGGS can be viewed as a **data framework** especially when being used to intergrade multi-source spatial data, where heterogenous datasets align automatically in DGGS. Most of the previous literature regarding the application of DGGS in solving real-world problems employed DGGS as a uniform data framework to deal with heterogenous geospatial data. On the other hand, it can be a natural **datacube**, because of its congruent characteristics. From a macro perspective, DGGS has the potential to be a **digital earth** or a **spatial data infrastructure**. This will require the additional power of a DGGS, including the ability to crawl standard geospatial data from various resources, integrate data as a uniform format, support basic queries or operations, and deliver data or results to other spatial data infrastructures (interoperability).
